# Mark
Mark is an interactive application that uses PyQt5 to create a basic image editor. You can create marks based on any image that you want and then apply those marks to individual files in a folder or entire folders. This is a project that I decided to work on my own as a college student. The project is based in Python and it demonstrates the basic skills of how to use PyQt5 to create a GUI based application. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about the code.

### Requirements
To be able to run the Mark application you will need to have python installed in your machine. (Created with Python 3.8.0 / Tested on Python 3.8.0 and higher). You can download the stand alone application ( .exe file ) or download the source code. The stand alone application was created with py-installer.

Sections of the code that the mark application code uses is opensource code. This was used for a college course and all credit of any used code goes to the original creators of it, and me. This is not the final version of a project at all. It needs refinement, which it will happen. Feel free to leave comment and reach out with any questions.
